                                        ***Authentication***
                                        1. Authentication verifies who the user is.
                                        2.Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.
                                        3.Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.
                                        4.Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.
                                        ***Example***: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to an HR application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.

                                        ***Authorization***
                                        1.Authorization determines what resources a user can access.
                                        2.Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.
                                        3.Authorization always takes place after authentication.
                                        4.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.
                                        ***Example***: Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.
